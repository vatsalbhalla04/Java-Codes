1) Perform arraylist functions => al1.java ✅
2) Take the input from the user . => al2.java ✅
3) Make a class name : GU : sno sname eng hindi implement using arraylist => al3.java --> Create a class named GU with attributes sno, 
    sname, eng, and hindi, and use an ArrayList to store student marks. Do not use the class name Student as it is already a predefined 
    class, which could cause conflicts when creating an object. Instead, use a different name such as GU for your custom class, 
    and ensure that objects are instantiated from this class. Save the code in al3.java. ✅
